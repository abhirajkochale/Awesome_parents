## 🔐 Login Troubleshooting

### **"Login failed" error?**

**Common issues:**

1. **Haven't signed up yet**
   - Solution: Click "Sign Up" tab and create an account first

2. **Wrong username format**
   - Username must be letters, numbers, and underscores only
   - No spaces or special characters
   - Example: ✅ `john_smith` ❌ `john smith` ❌ `john@email`

3. **Wrong password**
   - Password is case-sensitive
   - Must be at least 6 characters
   - Try signing up with a new username if you forgot

4. **Using email instead of username**
   - Don't use `@miaoda.com` when logging in
   - Just use the username part
   - Example: If you signed up as `admin`, login with `admin` (not `admin@miaoda.com`)

### **How the login works:**
- You sign up with a **username** (e.g., `parent1`)
- System converts it to email format internally (`parent1@miaoda.com`)
- You login with just the **username** (e.g., `parent1`)
- Password must match what you set during signup
